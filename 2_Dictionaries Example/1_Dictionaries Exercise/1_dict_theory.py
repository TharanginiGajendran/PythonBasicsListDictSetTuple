# Introduction to Dictionaries
# A collection of key value pairs
# key => unique identifier

# value => any python object

# Dictionaries allows us to store and retrieve values based on their key,
# a way to map organized data efficiently

# syntax => ditct_name = {
#                key1: value1,
#                key2: value2,
#                key3: value3,
#                ....
#                }


# cannot have two items with same key
# Dictionaries are mutable
