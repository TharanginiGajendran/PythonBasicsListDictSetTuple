# Missing element representation


  # List Representation
  # A set is represented by listing the elements of it
  #  Below is simple list representation

  # A = {1,2,3,a,b}


  # Predicate Representation
  # A set is defined by predicate
  # Predicate is more convinient than list representation

  #  B = {x|x is an odd positive integer}

  # | =>meaning such that
  # P(x) => mean odd positive integer =>predicate representation
  #  B = {x| P(x)}
